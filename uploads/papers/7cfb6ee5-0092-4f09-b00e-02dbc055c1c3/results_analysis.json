    "Modality and Stroop Effects": "Strong modality effect with higher IES in auditory vs. visual tasks. Classical Stroop effect observed with lower IES for congruent trials. Interaction shows stronger Stroop effect in auditory modality.",
    "Gratton Effect Modulation": "Gratton effect present with lower IES after incongruent trials. This effect was significant only after placebo stimulation, not after inhibitory TBS over right DLPFC.",
    "DLPFC Role in Control": "Right DLPFC activation stronger in high conflict-high control conditions. Inhibitory TBS reduced prefrontal activation and disrupted cognitive control mechanisms.",
    "Sensory Distractor Suppression": "Auditory cortex activity reduced in high control conditions during visual tasks with intact DLPFC. N170 amplitudes showed visual distractor suppression modulated by stimulation condition.",
    "Behavioral-Cortical Correlations": "Attentional control scores correlated with behavioral Gratton effect and right DLPFC activation. Cognitive failures negatively correlated with DLPFC activation in high control conditions."
