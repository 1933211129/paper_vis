  "Background/Problem": "The neural mechanisms by which the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) accomplishes cognitive control during conflict resolution remain unclear.",
  "Method/Approach": "Researchers used an audiovisual Stroop task with fNIRS and EEG measurements, and applied inhibitory TMS over the right DLPFC to test its causal role.",
  "Result": "The DLPFC suppresses distracting sensory input in auditory cortex and visual system during high-conflict situations, and an intact DLPFC enables conflict adaptation (Gratton effect).",
  "Conclusion/Contribution": "These findings provide causal evidence for the DLPFC's role in establishing conflict resolution across different sensory modalities in humans."
