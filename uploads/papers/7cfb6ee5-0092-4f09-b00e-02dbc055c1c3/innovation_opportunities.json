  "limitation_breakthrough": "Develop a closed-loop neurostimulation system that uses real-time fNIRS/EEG feedback to dynamically adjust TMS parameters, moving beyond static stimulation to adaptively target DLPFC based on moment-to-moment conflict processing states.",
  "methodological_improvement": "Implement high-density EEG with source localization to precisely map the temporal dynamics of sensory cortex modulation, overcoming the spatial limitations of 12-channel EEG while maintaining the temporal resolution needed to track rapid conflict adaptation processes.",
  "application_expansion": "Apply the multimodal TMS-fNIRS-EEG approach to clinical populations with known DLPFC dysfunction, such as ADHD or schizophrenia, to investigate whether impaired conflict adaptation stems from deficient sensory distractor suppression and test therapeutic stimulation protocols.",
