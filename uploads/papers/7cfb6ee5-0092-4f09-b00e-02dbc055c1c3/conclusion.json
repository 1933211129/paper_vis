    "DLPFC Top-Down Control": "The DLPFC is critically involved in top-down control of sensory areas during high-conflict situations, modulating sensory cortices to optimize behavioral responses.",
    "Distractor Suppression Mechanism": "Conflict-related modulation in sensory areas like FFA and auditory cortex primarily involves distractor suppression, not stimulus amplification, to reduce response conflict.",
    "Prefrontal Inhibition Effects": "Temporary inhibition of the prefrontal cortex significantly reduced sensory cortex modulation, indicating DLPFC's role in invoking specialized response patterns."
