    "Neural Shot Change Detection": "Shot changes are identified at the neurological level via theta and delta frequency band responses, with hippocampal activity supporting perception of these cinematic events.",
    "Cognitive Encoding and Decoding": "Theta and delta modulations suggest spectator cognition requires neural processes for encoding and decoding, linked to memory and language processing in the left hemisphere.",
    "Hippocampus and Spatiotemporal Encoding": "The study highlights hippocampus involvement in spatial-temporal reality encoding, linking neural activity to how viewers process cinematic shot changes.",
    "Future Experimental Verifications": "Two verifications are needed: testing cuts violating spatiotemporal unity and identifying unit changes within shots before exploring linguistic process correlations."
