    "Common Neural Response Patterns": "ERD/ERS analysis revealed theta and delta band synchronizations and desynchronizations in specific time windows post-cut, with distinct spatial distributions across parietal, frontal, and central brain regions.",
    "Taxonomy-Based Neural Differences": "Significant neural pattern differences were found for the G2 taxonomy (based on shot relationships) but not for G1 (based on incoming shot only), indicating relational cognitive processing of cuts.",
    "Frequency and Timing Analysis": "Neural variances were identified in theta/high theta (0-400ms) and delta/low delta (500-1000ms) bands, with specific electrode activations in central, posterior, and frontal regions showing lateralization.",
    "Cognitive and Linguistic Implications": "Left lateralization in theta responses and hippocampal involvement suggest connections to memory, time perception, and potential parallels with cognitive language processes, supporting film as a language."
