  "Background/Problem": "This study explores if the cinematographic cut functions as an articulation axis between adjacent shots, requiring common neural patterns and variations by cut type.",
  "Method/Approach": "The study analyzed neural responses to continuity editing cuts using EEG recordings from 21 participants, combining cinematographic theory with cognitive neuroscience methods.",
  "Result": "Analysis revealed theta synchronization and delta desynchronization patterns in EEG, associated with memory encoding, narrative segmentation, and meaning construction during cuts.",
  "Conclusion/Contribution": "Shot changes are processed as relational events, supporting the hypothesis that cuts serve as neurally processed articulatory mechanisms in film structure."
