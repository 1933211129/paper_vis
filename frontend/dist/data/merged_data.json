Classically, video data is streamed simultaneously to compute and storage systems for various processing tasks, such as inference, exemplar selection, and storage, thereby increasing I/O bandwidth and system processing demands. This processing complexity necessitates substantial compute and memory resources, escalating power consumption (e.g., systems with CPUs having a thermal design power of $145\\mathrm{W}$ and 64GB of DRAM as noted in Table 1) and requiring larger form factors, which exceed the capabilities of intermittent systems and challenge sustainability goals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to minimize compute and power requirements in archival processes. Moreover, the divergence of analytics and archival pipelines from the outset suggests that optimizing both hardware, software and data-flow used in inference, learning and archival could significantly enhance throughput and energy efficiency. This can be achieved by using modern neural compression algorithms instead of the classical encoding algorithm. However, the neural compression algorithm needs to be compute efficient (reusing maximum analytics pipeline), have high compression ratio (need to compete with H264) and feature rich (could be decompressed and retrieved with a reasonable loss). Furthermore, it needs to take advantage of the data similarity between frames to further minimize the storage footprint, and thereby reducing the form factor and need of frequent disk swapping/ maintenance.

Historically, researchers have investigated these components individually, often focusing on highperformance computing, scientific computing, and database applications. However, the specificdemands of ML applications on storage systems have largely been overlooked. storage stack architects often abstract the computational processes, neglecting considerations such as data movementcost, compute cost, and power requirements. Conversely, architects of storage drives, including CSDs,tend to overlook the broader application requirements, such as data prioritization, potential offloadingof computational tasks to storage, and application-specific data compression and encryption strategies. Our research aims to bridge this gap, focusing specifically on the exigencies of continuous learningapplications.",

The mathematical formulation for this training process is centered around minimizing the reconstruction loss, $\\begin{array}{r}{L=\\sum_{t=1}^{N}\\|F_{t}-\\hat{F}_{t}\\|_{2}^{2}}\\end{array}$ ; where $F_{t}$ is the original frame at time $t$ , and $\\hat{F}_{t}$ is the reconstructed frame, obt ained by decoding the compressed representation that was encoded using features extracted via MobileNet and refined by the motion vector-informed autoencoder. The backpropagation is applied only to the layers of the autoencoder, ensuring that the feature extractor’s parameters remain intact. This approach not only preserves the integrity of the visual features derived from MobileNet but also tailors the compression mechanism to be highly adaptive to the content-specific characteristics captured by these features.

Autonomous driving and urban mobility applications, generating over 400TB of data annually (Wright\"; \"premioinc\"; Bhardwaj et al., 2022), predominantly comprise video and 3D point cloud data, making them ideal for our evaluation. The Cityscapes data-set (Cordts et al., 2015) is a comprehensive collection of urban street scenes from 50 different cities, providing a rich source of annotated video data for semantic urban scene understanding. This data-set is particularly suited for evaluating the performance of Salient Store in dense, urban environments. Another video data-set, the Waymo Open Data-set (Sun et al., 2020), is one of the largest and most diverse data-sets for autonomous driving. It offers high-resolution sensor data, including LIDAR and camera recordings, across a variety of urban and suburban landscapes. This data-set’s volume and diversity make it an excellent benchmark for assessing Salient Store ’s capabilities in handling large-scale, real-world data. For 3D point cloud data, we selected the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite (Geiger et al., 2012), a fundamental data-set in autonomous driving research. It includes a variety of data types and tasks, providing a real-world urban driving context that is essential for testing Salient Store ’s performance in processing and managing 3D spatial data. Additionally, the nuScenes data-set (Caesar et al., 2020) by Aptiv, with its comprehensive sensor data and annotations covering diverse driving scenes, is instrumental in evaluating Salient Store ’s efficiency in multi-modal data processing typical in urban mobility scenarios. Beyond the visionbased data, we also incorporated the Chime Audio data-set (Foster et al., 2015) into our evaluation. This data-set, consisting of audio recordings, offers a different modality to test the versatility of Salient Store in handling various types of continuous learning data beyond visual inputs. In our comparative analysis, we employ VSS: A Video Storage System (Haynes et al., 2021) as a “baseline”, given its innovative approach in optimizing video data management. VSS excels in decoupling high-level video operations from storage and retrieval processes, efficiently organizing data on disk, enhancing caching mechanisms, and reducing redundancies in multi-camera setups (Haynes et al., 2021). This system has demonstrated significant improvements in VDBMS read performance, up to $54\\%$ , and a reduction in storage costs by up to $45\\%$ (Haynes et al., 2021).

Furthermore, each server performs more remoteaccesses, increasing the contention even more. This leads to an exponential growth in latency withthe increase in the number of storage servers used per application. It is recommended to contain mostof the data belonging to the same application in the same storage server to minimize remove diskaccesses over network.",
